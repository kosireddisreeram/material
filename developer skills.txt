we need to use the strict mode in the js file . 

if we use the strict mode in the javascript file wecannot able use the variable which are not defined


syntax:
use 'strict'
var x=1.2;
document.write(X);
we will get an error because we had not declared the variable previously.
correct syntax:
use 'strict'
var x;
var x = 19;
document.write(x);
